# Service Mentor

This is flutter app for car service & maintenance. User can request the different type of service for their car. A worker will take the vehicle to their service center. After completion of service they will delivery back to the owner of the vehicle. The payment can be done online or COD. This the concept of this app.

About this app:

User can login/register using email & password. Basic level of email and password validation is done in this app. There different section of service are shown on the home screen and there are different types of those services. user can add the service to the cart. All the email, passoword and cart database is stored in the Firebase. The ui of app is taken from dribble.com and some ui elements are from a food delivery app which I remove in the future. the project is not yet complete it does not have payment system and service center app.
